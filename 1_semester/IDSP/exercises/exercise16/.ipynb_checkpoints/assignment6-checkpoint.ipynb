    "# Assignment 6\n",
    "#### Due October 28, 2020, 23:59\n",

    "This week's assignment is about simulating a game, namely the famous casino game **craps**. \n",
    "You'll be asked to study the game description in detail and write python code that simulates the game in accordance with these rules. You will then be studying the win rate of the game in relation to the law of large numbers.\n",

    "## Submission\n",
    "Edit and turn in this jupyter notebook file containing your solutions to each task.  \n",
    "Implement your solution to each of the exercises in the code field below the exercise description.  \n",

    "### Craps\n",
    "The game of craps is a dice game you'll find in pretty much every casino in the world. The probability of winning craps is approximately 49.3 %.  \n",
    "The game is played with two six-sided dice and consists of two phases: \n",
    "1. **Come-out roll**: the player rolls the two dice. If the sum of the dice is 2, 3 or 12, the player immediately loses. If the sum is 7 or 11, the player immediately wins. Any other come-out roll causes the player to continue to the next phase.\n",
    "2. **Point roll**: the player keeps rolling the two dice again and again until either re-rolling their come-out roll sum or rolling a 7. If the player gets their come-out sum before rolling a 7, the player wins. If a 7 is rolled first, the player loses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is illustrated in the figure and examples below.\n",

    "If you try calling `estimate_craps_win_rate(n, seed)` with `n` set to 5 or 10, you’ll notice that the estimated probability may be far from 0.493. However, if you attempt with larger values of `n` you’ll notice that the probability stabilizes.\n",
    "This is explained by a theory called *the Law of Large Numbers* which states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value. In layman’s terms, this means that while a simulation may defy chance in a few cases, it rarely does so consistently over time. Your task is to investigate\n",

    "Run `estimate_craps_win_rate(n, seed)` for all values of `n`, 1 &leq; n &leq; 1000, and the`seed` set to 17. Plot the resulting values as a scatter plot. The figure should include a horizontal line showing the true winning probability of 0.493.\n",
